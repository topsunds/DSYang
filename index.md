# **Experiences**
## **Research Experiences:**
### 09/2014-Present, M.Sc. Student, Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University
  - Main research focus is image fusion.
  - Research on transform domain image fusion methods and the design of self-adaptive fusion rules.
  - Research on the combined fusion framework of spatial domain and transform domain fusion methods.

### 09/2015-Present, Research Assistant, Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University
  - Main participant of my supervisor’s research project “Shearlet Domain Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Non-Local Similarity and BM3D”, supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.  
  - Apply non-local similarity and collaborative filtering on shearlet domain fusion as well as propose a shearlet-domain fusion method base on “Block-matching and 3D filtering” (BM3D).
  - Research on the realization of 3D block-matching and the algorithm design of grouping by similarity.

### 01/2016-Present, Principal Investigator, Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University
  - Principal investigator of research project “Image Fusion Algorithm Based on 3D Transform and Block-Matching”, supported by Graduate Science and Technology Innovation Fund, BJTU.
  - Optimized the effect of image fusion by using block-matching and 3D transform before multi-scale transform to gain more spatial domain feature information assists transform domain fusion.

## **Project Experiences:**
### 04/2015-Present, Developer, Multi Flash Points Recognition Software, China Academy of Railway Sciences
